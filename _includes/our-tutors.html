          At Dino Tutors, we are committed to excellence. We source only the best tutors from around London.
          Each and every one goes through an extensive interview process to make sure they are the right pick for your family.

          TutorCruncher Socket lists your approved tutors from within the system, including subjects they teach and at what level they teach them and
          any customisable fields you wish to include.</p>
        <p class="tc-desc">
          A client can click on a tutor's profile to view their profiles and request them. If this happens, all
          relevant admins within TutorCruncher would receive and email with the client's details as well as creating them as a Prospect Client.
          Optionally, a new job would be created in the system with the tutor as an applicant for it.
